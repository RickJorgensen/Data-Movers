That, however, is not the point.Unless you live in a very deep and dark hole, literally everyone on the planet has the knowledge they need to make an informed decision. That is the point. It’s THEIR decision- not mine, not yours, THEIRS. Currently, around 90%+ of the people that get covid are unvaccinated. Again, they know the consequences. Let them make their decision.I see this as a collective body trying to shame others to accept their beliefs. It would be offensive for people to try to “persuade” people that are overweight to achieve a healthier weight. We all KNOW the consequences and literally everyone can achieve that goal (some with more struggles than others) yet we would NEVER do that. Why? Because it’s really not my (or your) business even though it definitely raises health care rates for everyone.Please, keep your thoughts about vaccination to yourself and let people decide for themselves.P.S. I have been vaccinated. My choice."

Took a riverboat cruise on the Mississippi for a couple hours that was informative and then walked around the town looking for a coffee shop (none were open in the afternoon). Ran across a closed Arthur Murray ballroom dance studio reminding me of my days in San Diego. Some nice walks and relaxing days just seeing the city and surroundings. Along the way we saw the way lakes have specific areas where fish are caught. It looks like buckets of blue hoses are sunk at the bottom of the lake near a shore to encourage fish to be in that area (at least I’m guessing their function). Learned something new!",

We did a one night stopover in Nebraska City where we were (again) treated to the “severe thunderstorms” of the Midwest. We woke up at 1am to 70 mph winds and hail buffeting the coach. After about an hour, things calmed down and we were heading back to sleep. Got up again and mozzied down the road ‘bout an hour to Lincoln, NE and checked in to the only campground in the area that was fiendishly expensive but since it’s only for 2 nights, we will suck it up. The heat finally broke and we were treated to a nice mid-70 degree afternoon and evening so Teresa suggested we breakout the fire pit and made the first campfire of the summer. Very nice change of pace and a chance to sit outside without dripping in wet clothes. We head on out toward Chicago where we get to meet up with my sister and brother-in-law to enjoy the tourist stuff for a day. Looking forward to that.",

While the Truman library was “full” (limited number of folks can enter for the day), we went instead to the Truman House where a bored ranger took us on a tour of the outside and explain all kinds of trivia about the Truman’s. Along with all the great stories of their private lives, he took us out back to the garage to see the last cat that Harry ever owned (complete with a custom license plate commemorating the surrender of Germany). Coupled with a video of their daughter Margaret interviewing them both on an old recording , provided a rare insight to the Truman’s. Really looking forward to coming back.

Now that we don’t have a lot of specific places to be at specific times, we find that we like a 2-3 hour move better than a 12 hour drive day.We ended up at (yet another) elk club in blue springs (about 30 min east of Kansas City) that is gorgeous. We back up to a huge valley and green spaces with 50 amp service , water and sewer for $25 a night - campers trifecta. Below are some pics of our morning view.I’m on a quest to see all the presidential libraries for modern presidents and they are finally starting to reopen. As we drove thru the Midwest, the Truman library is an obvious stop. We rolled into a wonderful elks club for a couple of days. Unfortunately, the library uses timed tickets and they are full up for the next several days. We do have a couple of places we need to be in a bit so we can’t stay long enough to get in so we will have to come back some other day.Teresa found “stuff to do” in the mean time. We went to union station, built in 1914, abandoned and then refurbished to a great attraction. As we drove in yesterday, the rain came down in BUCKETS to the point we almost couldn’t see the road. It cleared up about an hour later. Attached are some photos of the station. It was HUGE. Several small museums inside (the lego and train exhibits were cute) as well as just walking around the massive open structure. Afterwards, we went to the Westin across the street for a glass of ice tea and sat in the atrium. Teresa is pictured here next to a large indoor waterfall.Tomorrow we are off to see more of the city and then leave for Nebraska.",

While we were in Dallas, we connected up with our good friend mark Loovis and had amazing BBQ at the Pecan Lodge (not to be missed).

Definitely a place to return!We packed up just before the 4th and stayed at our next “goto place”, and he elks lodge just north of Oklahoma City where were were treated to a great 4th of July cookout and fireworks show. Along the way, met new friends mark and Debra McCoy.

Simple. Find a bar and hunker down.  Found a nice little dive and waiting for the train to come. While we were waiting , having a drink (or 2 - this IS Chicago after all), we chatted with the owner and he offered us a shot of something called “Malort”.

We paid the bill, went to hook up and BOOM, the surge protector said “are you KIDDING ME? No way!”. The park had crappy electricity. I went to the owner and he said “what do you want me to do about it?”. I said call an electrician and fix the pedestal. He told me I could have my money back. Needless to say, we left pronto. Any park that refuses to take care of their basic stuff like electricity is bad news. We will see if he actually issues a refund.Went down the road a bit and found a great park with lots of space and clean electricity.

While it was a little on the way side, seeing our friends , Lisa and Greg Swinney was something we couldn’t pass up. After a fair number of drinks, they mentioned a party they were going to the next day and invited us along. What a treat! They had an amazing array of food they cooked for everyone under a huge tent in their backyard. They had huge shrimp (cocktail and garlic), rabbit, shark , pheasant, quail, gator tail, venison , ribeye, chicken , you name it , they cooked it. I have never sampled such good cooking at one time. We left STUFFED!  Great company and good times! Teresa has the pictures on her phone but here is the menu they put together!",

I though you and Teresa were in Florida!Well, yes we were but now traveling north to grand design headquarters for a little warranty work on our coach. On our way, we stopped in Nashville for a break. We discovered oh so much!First, we walked down Broadway with honky tonks and bars lining the street with music blasting so loud your head hurt. Fun but a bit unnerving.  We also discovered that they LOVE rooftop bars. We went up to Luke Bryan’s place and had the privilege of paying $50 for 2 drinks and a chicken sandwich (which was good).We didn’t have time to visit all the museums and parks but had a great intro walking around.The next day we took a city bus tour and learned lots about the city and some great places to go next time (did you know they have a replica of the Greek Parthenon?) also, the (technically) tallest building in the city is the ATT building , affectionately called “the Batman building” for its dual spires.We finished the day with a tour of Andrew Jackson’s mansion and grounds. Learned so much about him and how he lived his life. Something not to be missed. As a bonus, we stayed at the same rv park we had done 4 years ago and had a wonderful stay with live music every night. What a treat! Cant wait to come back and enjoy the city more.",

Here are a couple of thoughts to process. Your mileage may vary.\n\nI\u2019m fat, old and diabetic with high blood pressure so I have what you call \u201cunderlying conditions\u201d. When our doctor told us to go get tested (teresa got it before me), we did the 15 min test immediately and got the results ..... positive.\n\nMy first reaction was fear. OMG, I\u2019m gonna die. This is it. It\u2019s over. We then immediately informed the few people we came in contact with so they could get tested (they were negative because we social distance). After I calmed down and called the doctor back, he sent us to the hospital for an \u201cantibody infusion\u201d. For the next 48 hours, I had a high fever, fatigue and a few body aches but Tylenol took care of the discomfort. After that, nothing. Felt just fine. Teresa was less than me. Just felt like the flu.\n\nWe maintained quarantine completely and finished without any recurrence.\n\nSome say \u201cyou are lucky\u201d but as I talk to more people, this is a normal occurrence. Our story is more common than not.\n\nToday, it would be highly unlikely for us to spread covid. For me to transmit it I would have to have someone cough or spit in my face, live virus would stay in my nose and I would have to cough or spit in someone else\u2019s face. Pretty damn unlikely. Any virus in my system is dead. When they tell us we can have the vaccine, we will take it as a precaution and we expect it will be required when we travel internationally.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I\u2019m angry at all the hoopla about covid today. In the beginning, we didn\u2019t have vaccines or treatments that we have now. I\u2019m angry at myself for letting myself feel so afraid initially when there was really no good reason to. I get that there are those that are fearful but honestly, it\u2019s like anything in life. There are unknowns that can hurt you and can\u2019t prevent. This is one of those things. As much as you try to \u201ccontrol\u201d the virus, you just can\u2019t. You need to be exposed to build immunity and if you are exposed, the treatments we have are effective. \n\nI\u2019m hopeful that once everyone has had the opportunity to accept or reject the vaccine, we all go back to normal. Burn your stupid mask, hug your friends\/loved ones, don\u2019t live in isolation or fear, kids go back to school. If you believe  sleepy creepy joe, that will be in 6 months tops. He should  thank trump for all that work but he won\u2019t:-)\n\nI\u2019m cynical enough to believe that that will not happen because so much FEAR has been created in \u201cthe name of science and public health\u201d as well as the media\u2019s vested interest in keeping the \u201cstory\u201d going that the elites will continue to gaslight the public.  Just keep these few things in mind.\n\n- covid is NOT a death sentence.\n- you can\u2019t control it despite your attempts. Nature will find a way.\n- take the vaccine or not. It\u2019s your choice but we need to return to normal after everyone that wants the vaccine can get it. Dont shame people for their choices.\n- we have lots of great treatments to minimize the impact. \n-don\u2019t live in fear. It\u2019s not worth it.\n-promote businesses that support life before covid behavior. Don\u2019t support those that promote fear.","created_time":"2021-02-14T19:53:52+0000"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10221991806358872","type":"status","message":"Dallas,TX\n\nGoing a little stir crazy.

I look at people I have known all my life so hate-filled that they agree with opinions they would never express as their own. I think that I may well have entered the Twilight Zone.\n\nYou can't justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind.\n\nWe see other countries going Socialist and collapsing, but it seems like a great plan to us.\n\nSomehow it\u2019s un-American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.\n\nPeople who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.\n\nUniversities that advocate equality, discriminate against Asian-Americans in favor of African-Americans.\n\nSome people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.\n\nCriminals are caught-and-released to hurt more people, but stopping them is bad because it's a violation of THEIR rights.\n\nPeople who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.\n\nAfter legislating gender, if a dude pretends to be a woman, you are required to pretend with him.\n\nIt was cool for Joe Biden to \"blackmail\" the President of Ukraine, but it\u2019s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.\n\nPeople who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for their degrees.\n\nImmigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome, but you\u2019d better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.\n\nIrish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate to the US must go through a rigorous vetting process, but any illiterate gang-bangers who jump the southern fence are welcomed.\n\n$5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for \u201cfree\u201d health care is not.\n\nIf you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.\n\nAnd, pointing out all this hypocrisy somehow makes us \"racists\"!\n\nNothing makes sense anymore, no values, no morals, no civility and people are dying of a Chinese virus, but it is racist to refer to it as Chinese even though it began in China.\n\nWe are clearly living in an upside-down world where right is wrong and wrong is right, where moral is immoral and immoral is moral, where good is evil and evil is good, where killing murderers is wrong, but killing innocent babies is right.\n\nWake up America.

The King James I Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70\u0025 of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.\n\nIreland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.\n\nFrom 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Ireland\u2019s population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britain\u2019s solution was to auction them off as well.\n\nDuring the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.\n\nMany people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. They\u2019ll come up with terms like \u201cIndentured Servants\u201d to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.\n\nAs an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology were more expensive to purchase, at the time.\n\nAfrican slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the master\u2019s free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.\n\nIn time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new \u201cmulatto\u201d slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed \u201cforbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale.\u201d In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.\n\nEngland continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.\n\nThere is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satan\u2019s highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.\n\nBut, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then they\u2019ve got it completely wrong.\n\nIrish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.","created_time":"2020-06-21T23:45:37+0000"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10220229539743308","type":"photo","message":"Maryland-\n\nThe states are getting smaller in the northeast.

There is no black and white solution.\n\nBut the more the nation is divided by SHAMING the other side to try to gain leverage for a political or social agenda, the more we all suffer needlessly in endless arguments.\n\nAs a nation, we must shift from the quarantine of 300 million people to the quarantine of tens of thousands of the most high-risk people INSTEAD.  This is not rocket science, but it also *IS* rocket science - it's complicated and not simple, and requires a lot of negotiation and protest and negotiation and protest.\n\nStop the shaming and hate, focus on concrete actions to TRANSITION without trashing anyone who doesn't agree with you.  For example, if people want to re-open a small business that will soon go under, it doesn't mean that person wants to kill children.  It means they are just as afraid as you are, but for a different reason.","created_time":"2020-05-17T11:16:36+0000"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10219916562599075","type":"status","message":"Truth.","created_time":"2020-05-16T10:19:22+0000"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10219912472536826","type":"photo","message":"This

A free society has consequences with free choice but legitimate mental illness is something we should care for and treat, not lump in with addiction.","created_time":"2019-11-16T16:51:04+0000","full_picture":"https:\/\/external-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQE_kWKQ78r3Zvfi&url=https\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fstatic.foxnews.com\u00252Ffoxnews.com\u00252Fcontent\u00252Fuploads\u00252F2019\u00252F11\u00252Foakland-homeless-2.jpg&ccb=3-5&_nc_hash=AQGNl0I9eFnwyubj"}],"paging":{"previous":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/v11.0\/10222930152176931\/posts?access_token=EAAE9G6tDQsIBACtuvnCtqbv1OBAMMrHiJFH42LHIw5EL9J17tS8NZCLeyLkXTRlZAyVk03wl4c7yULhcAOQNFx56ZAf0110dbQjxqd2ZCOne9ZAjTZAFzZAnzhf7ixseHmE8wFV0OcZACLtfopFagDw36vbwWkmCConnmEGoPJ2MfrRbZBlU3hneOf0NkuJKZAGxYZD&pretty=0&fields=id\u00252Ctype\u00252Cmessage\u00252Ccreated_time\u00252Cfull_picture&since=1582572848&until&__previous=1&__paging_token=enc_AdAdxRXTZCdsvDzG08Y4hTZCz1MGseUrLKhQ9SSmALd4hGODj4khm4Vewa88ig1JmmpZBbAMF8P69XUScfaRITnUHiZAIcBtOTJTtqpdEB092IfZCUvFA2ASybTVqDKRBZCmxCc6sZD","next":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/v11.0\/10222930152176931\/posts?access_token=EAAE9G6tDQsIBACtuvnCtqbv1OBAMMrHiJFH42LHIw5EL9J17tS8NZCLeyLkXTRlZAyVk03wl4c7yULhcAOQNFx56ZAf0110dbQjxqd2ZCOne9ZAjTZAFzZAnzhf7ixseHmE8wFV0OcZACLtfopFagDw36vbwWkmCConnmEGoPJ2MfrRbZBlU3hneOf0NkuJKZAGxYZD&pretty=0&fields=id\u00252Ctype\u00252Cmessage\u00252Ccreated_time\u00252Cfull_picture&since&until=1573923064&__paging_token=enc_AdDZCXY3SQRFpyuz3hXuKV9ydakE8gZAWLhjPOcCdXCVwy4lEuSlU7SluZC1U2PAfiXi3PLgy3ybVWRZC7qTW7BmoWWzYLWf1pdR2u8onDSPKf1w0NtZCIK2UxMqcadrCUGddraIZD&__previous"}}

Amazing views of the city and astronomy. Getting up there was a challenge (took the bus up.

We love them.\n\n9)There is no possible way to exceed the posted speed limit in most roads. The signs are really a dare.\n\n10)It never rains in Ireland (at least that is what they tell the tourists). NOT!\n\n11)They are called \u201ctyres\u201d over here ... not \u201ctires\u201d and there are more tyre stores and than there are Starbucks shops!

We travel so well together and love the same things at the same time.\n\n4) Americans are not as rude overseas as I remember them being.

American sports fans don\u2019t hold a candle to these guys.\n\n6) in the countryside, the Irish REALLY hate the English. Looking at the churches burned to the ground is a constant reminder of what they did in the 16th century. In the city, not so much.

Walking out with a smooth as silk face, we made our way up the island toward Dingle.\n\nWithout any reservations, we stopped off at a couple and discovered that they don\u2019t seem to open until at least 5pm! Fortunately, we found a delightful place on the edge of a river flowing out to the ocean. The place was booked up but his brother has an Airbnb that had not been rented out for the 2 days we needed it right next door! Got checked in and Teresa promptly grabbed the bed to lay down as I headed (you guessed it) to the attached pub for another pint of Guinness. \n\nTomorrow we are off to Dingle to view more of this lovely country.","created_time":"2018-07-11T16:52:04+0000","full_picture":"https:\/\/scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.6435-9\/s720x720\/36914122_10214549534666731_3268801211284848640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=oipHsWPCfoUAX8Itf41&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&edm=ACwmWnUEAAAA&oh=e539f822330195703c587f69f228c98b&oe=61280E5E"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10214543745762012","type":"photo","message":"Bonus pictures from tonight.","created_time":"2018-07-10T20:48:29+0000","full_picture":"https:\/\/scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.6435-9\/p180x540\/37025615_10214543745362002_4311633006059061248_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=4PHKvb0HVjAAX9WDc-D&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&edm=ACwmWnUEAAAA&oh=793603d6533d8097a952093ce02e0f57&oe=612644E0"},{"id":"10222930152176931_10214542625013994","type":"photo","message":"Day 13...... are we getting old and slowing down???\n\nDrove out to Kinsale today (about an hour and a half).
